## What was learned?
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) was a concept almost unknown to us before this project.  
One of the main goals was to use OOP as efficiently as possible.  
This includes taking advantage of JavaScript classes:  

    class Example {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    }  
As well as importing and exporting those classes amongst eachother:

    import domUpdates from './domUpdates.js';
    import data from './data.js';
    import Game from './Game.js';
    import Player from './Player.js';
    import $ from 'jquery';

## Challenges we faced
Undoubtedly, the biggest challenge of this project has been enabling the JavaScript classes to speak to one another. Not understanding how it worked at the beginning of the project was a major setback, but it's something we have risen above.

## Project "Wins"
Working remotely was simultaneously a challenge and an overall win for us. We both go to school in Denver; however, we live in different cities. In the end, we were able to accomplish a lot working remotely, which is a skill we are happy to have learned.
