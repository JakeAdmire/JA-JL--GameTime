## What was learned?
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) was a concept almost unknown to us before this project.  
One of the main goals was to use OOP as efficiently as possible.  
This includes taking advantage of JavaScript classes:  

    class Example {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    }  
As well as importing and exporting those classes amongst eachother:

    import domUpdates from './domUpdates.js';
    import data from './data.js';
    import Game from './Game.js';
    import Player from './Player.js';
    import $ from 'jquery';

## Challenges we faced
Undoubtedly, the biggest challenge of this project has been forcing the JavaScript classes to speak to one another. Not understanding how it worked at the beginning of the project was a major setback, but it's something we have risen above.

## Future Implementation Plans
**Given the time** we would like to implement these features:
- Multiple rounds rather than being stuck on round 1
- Cleaner, DRYer CSS code
- Mobility
